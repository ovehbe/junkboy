# SMS Classification Model Information

## Model File: sms_model.tflite

This is a placeholder for your trained TensorFlow Lite model.

### How to Create Your Model:

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Collect SMS messages with labels (GENERAL, PROMOTION, NOTIFICATION, TRANSACTION, JUNK)
   Format: "message text", "label"

2. **Train Model**: Use TensorFlow/Keras to train a text classification model
   - Use TextVectorization for preprocessing
   - Try LSTM, GRU, or 1D-CNN architectures
   - Include both English and Turkish text samples

3. **Convert to TensorFlow Lite**: 
   ```python
   converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(model_path)
   converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
   tflite_model = converter.convert()
   ```

4. **Place Model**: Save the .tflite file as "sms_model.tflite" in this assets folder

### Model Requirements:
- Input: Text sequence (up to 100 tokens)
- Output: 5 class probabilities (GENERAL, PROMOTION, NOTIFICATION, TRANSACTION, JUNK)
- Format: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)

### For Testing:
The app will work without the model file using rule-based classification as fallback.

### Example Training Script:
See the project documentation for a complete training script example.
